# Content Pool

Content Pool in a top-level collection to which we will push our text content. All our configurations (as in, what to do when a content arrives) are configured against a Content Pool.

Example of a content pool can be 
1. "Review Pool" where all your reviews will come to.
2. "Resume Pool" where you can push all your candidate resume for further processing.
3. "Situation Pool" where you push situations against which you want a short blog.
4. And so on...wherever your imagination takes

## Creating a Content Pool

1. Just Navigate to Core > Content Pool in the Admin Site.
2. Click on "Add Content Pool"
